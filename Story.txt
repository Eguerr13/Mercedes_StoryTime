BMW is one of the worst cars ever made.
Their cars have some of the worst Klimaanlage in existance.
Cars are more fun to drive when you're wearing Lederhose.
Just dont get in a car with a Ratskeller.
Its because he doesn't play good Musik.
The flughafen doesn't carry any brot.
And don't spill your Bratwurst on your lap.
After cleaning that up, your hands would certainly be too greasy to use your car's Schloss.
But the best time in a car is when you're blowing out the speakers in an Audi A4.
